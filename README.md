# IdentifyPhish üêü
This python script helps the user make a logical and not an emotion decision when coming across a phishing email.
Prior to running, I would recommend checking the File Hash to make sure it has not been modified during installation. 


File Hashes:
- SHA256: 4626c25c60a38d2f5e38df83420c9619208d4aef376bec32f317918a0149e40d
- MD5: a6451e25b9fd33086451e424777eac5e
- Once checked the file hashes, run the .exe file and follow the instructions in order to check if your email is phishing.

Step By Step Instructions:
1. Open a Python Interpreter and copy the code file.
2. Replace the example email with the email you want to check for phishing located in the user_email variable and make sure to keep a similar format witin the """ """ (tri-quotes).
3. Run all of the cells of the code. 
4. The code will output whether or not the email that was phishing attempt based on common phishing techniques.

If you want to learn more about phishing attempts, I would highly recommend checking out a completely free resource at: https://caniphish.com/free-phishing-test/phishing-awareness-training#what. This link will also be in the output after your provided email is analyzed for phishing.

Important Note: This code only provides a basic analysis of potential phishing emails. It's still important to verify the authenticity of any suspicious emails by contacting the sender directly through a different and trusted communication channel. Always verify before proceeding to take action.
