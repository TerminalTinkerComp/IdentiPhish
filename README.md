# IdentiPhish üêü
This python script helps the user make a logical and not an emotion decision when coming across a phishing email.

CAUTION: This code only provides a basic analysis of potential phishing emails. It's still important to verify the authenticity of any suspicious emails by contacting the sender directly through a different and trusted communication channel. Always verify before proceeding to take action.
Prior to running, I would recommend checking the File Hash to make sure it has not been modified during installation. 

Step By Step Instructions:
  1. Install the IdentiPhish.zip
  2. Format your email to be one line. I recommend using LingoJam website: https://lingojam.com/TexttoOneLine
  3. Run the installed .exe file and click run any way option.
  4. Paste the email formated in one line after the message "Please enter the email you'd like to check for phishing (or type 'exit'):"
  5. The output will state whether or not the email that was phishing attempt based on common phishing techniques.
  6. Enjoy :)

*Important note: Windows Defender or alternative anti-virus software provider may alert you that file is potentially malicious. To ensure safety and intregrity of my product I always make sure to scan my developed projects with F-Suite before posting.

Make sure the hashes of the installed .exe folder matches the hashes below.
File Hashes:
- SHA256: 4626c25c60a38d2f5e38df83420c9619208d4aef376bec32f317918a0149e40d
- MD5: a6451e25b9fd33086451e424777eac5e
- Once checked the file hashes, run the .exe file and follow the instructions in order to check if your email is phishing.
