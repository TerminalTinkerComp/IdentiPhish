# IdentiPhish üêü
This python script helps the user make a logical and not an emotion decision when coming across a phishing email.

Step By Step Instructions when using the .exe code File:
  Prior to running, I would recommend checking the File Hash to make sure it has not been modified during installation. 
  *Important note: Windows Defender or alternative anti-virus software provider may alert you that file is potentially malicious. However, all the code used in the program is posted in the Python code file and has been converted to an .exe file for easy access. To ensure safety and intregrity of my product I always make sure to scan my developed projects with F-Suite   before posting.

  1. Install the .exe file in the directory.
  2. Make sure the hashes of the installed .exe folder matches the hashes below.
  3. Format your email to be one line. I recommend using LingoJam website: https://lingojam.com/TexttoOneLine
  4. Run the installed .exe file and click run any way option.
  5. Paste the email formated in one line after the message "Please enter the email you'd like to check for phishing (or type 'exit'):"
  6. The output will state whether or not the email that was phishing attempt based on common phishing techniques.

File Hashes:
- SHA256: 4626c25c60a38d2f5e38df83420c9619208d4aef376bec32f317918a0149e40d
- MD5: a6451e25b9fd33086451e424777eac5e
- Once checked the file hashes, run the .exe file and follow the instructions in order to check if your email is phishing.



Step By Step Instructions when using the Python code File:
1. Open a Python Interpreter and copy the code file.
2. Replace the example email with the email you want to check for phishing located in the user_email variable and make sure to keep a similar format witin the """ """ (tri-quotes).
4. Run all of the cells of the code. 
5. The code will output whether or not the email that was phishing attempt based on common phishing techniques.

If you want to learn more about phishing attempts, I would highly recommend checking out a completely free resource at: https://caniphish.com/free-phishing-test/phishing-awareness-training#what. This link will also be in the output after your provided email is analyzed for phishing.

Important Note: This code only provides a basic analysis of potential phishing emails. It's still important to verify the authenticity of any suspicious emails by contacting the sender directly through a different and trusted communication channel. Always verify before proceeding to take action.
